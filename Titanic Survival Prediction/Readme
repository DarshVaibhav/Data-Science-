# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin information.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on Titanic passengers, including:
- Age
- Gender
- Ticket class (Pclass)
- Fare
- Cabin information
- Other relevant features

## Preprocessing Steps
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Normalizing numerical data

## Model Development
- Implemented multiple classification models to predict survival
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics

## Expected Outcome
A well-trained classification model with strong survival prediction accuracy.
